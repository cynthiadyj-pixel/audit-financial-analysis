# Audit Risk Identification and Response

This notebook identifies key audit risks based on financial ratio
and trend analysis and proposes corresponding audit focus areas.

## Audit Risk 1: Revenue Recognition

**Risk Description:**  
Revenue growth in certain years is not fully supported by corresponding
operating cash flow, indicating potential revenue recognition risk.

**Supporting Evidence:**  
- Divergence between revenue and operating cash flow trends  
- Fluctuations in gross margin

**Audit Implications:**  
Improper timing of revenue recognition may result in overstated revenue
and profits.

**Proposed Audit Response:**  
- Perform detailed testing of revenue transactions  
- Review major contracts and revenue recognition policies  
- Conduct cut-off testing near year-end
## Audit Risk 2: Accounts Receivable Impairment

**Risk Description:**  
Accounts receivable balances increased while turnover ratios declined,
raising concerns over collectability.

**Supporting Evidence:**  
- Declining accounts receivable turnover  
- Increasing gap between revenue growth and cash collection

**Audit Implications:**  
Potential understatement of allowance for doubtful accounts.

**Proposed Audit Response:**  
- Test subsequent cash receipts  
- Review aging analysis of accounts receivable  
- Assess management’s impairment assumptions
## Audit Risk 3: Cost Allocation and Margin Volatility

**Risk Description:**  
Gross margin volatility suggests potential issues in cost allocation
and project cost recognition.

**Supporting Evidence:**  
- Significant year-on-year changes in gross margin  
- Industry characteristics involving long-term contracts

**Audit Implications:**  
Misstatement of project costs may distort profitability.

**Proposed Audit Response:**  
- Review project cost allocation methods  
- Test major cost components  
- Compare budgeted costs with actual costs
## Overall Audit Conclusion

Based on the financial analysis and trend observations,
revenue recognition, receivables impairment, and cost allocation
are identified as key audit risk areas that require heightened audit attention.
